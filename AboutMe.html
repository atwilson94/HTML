	<title>Welcome!</title>

			<h1 align="center">Some Info About Myself</h1>
			<p align="center">My name is Aaron Wilson and I was born and raised <br />In <strong><em>Greenville, NC</em></strong>.<br />
			I'm the youngest of four and I'm currently in college studying <i><b>Computer Programming</b></i> and
			<i><b>Network Technologies</b></i>. <br />I am currently on the path to graduate in the spring of 2018.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2 align="left">What I do</h2>
			<p>I pride myself in my customer service skills. I would definitely consider myself a <b><q>people person</q></b>.
			I enjoy working on my ability to write code effectively. Whether it be in <i>Python</i>, or just simple text
			documents like <em><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</em></abbr>. It all depends on how I feel that particular day. I wouldn't call myself a programmer just yet, although
			I have made a few simple programs in <i>Python</i> that are pretty interesting. My future work goals include working as a front-end or back-end programmer
			 or web developer once I graduate from college. And so far, although there have been very frustrating moments, I manage to stay focused on my work goals.</p>
			<p>I currently work in security while I continue to work towards my degree. Helping clients of all forms find solutions to their problems.
			What I've come to learn so far in both the security and IT industries is that networking is <b><i>VERY</i></b> important.
			Internships are hard to come by with no experience, but having someone to help you get you foot in the door in order to get crucial experience
			is key to a successful career. Along with being <b>exteremly</b> passionate about whatever it is that you do.
			So with that being said, below I will leave links to my <b>GitHub</b> so that you may see some of my personal work to this point,
			along with my <b>Linkedin</b> profile for networking purposes.
